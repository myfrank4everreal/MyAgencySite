VERY IMPORTANT NOTE:
make sure that you refrence the context variable not 
the variable in the forloop  when working on
object id 

set up urls for the app and the project
configure the database for sqlposgres
set up the models and make migrations
set up the views for the index function
make the static files functional
creat a basic form function for subscription which includes name and e-mail
creat five pages including the 'about us', contact, 'services',
login and sign in,
create a base template to work across all the pages
when everythin is functional push the github repository 
push to heroku 







so far so good 
we have been able connect to postgresql 
the static files are taking care of 
the base template is fixed we can dynamically and uniquly
render page contents



my sitetemplate is now fully functional for postgresql

i added a new blog app for testing purposes and it functioned 
well on heroku . 
so now i will create a new app heroku application for blog 
and i will leave this particular project app for as a template so
that any subsequent development that i will do will not require
going through the setup process.
so when ever i need this i can clone it and use it for my 
future developments.
Though i still have it on github i can also clone it from there


NOTE: DO NOT SAVE MORE THAN ONE URL AT THE SAME TIME IT CAUSES ERROR DUE TO 
CIRCULAR IMPORT. TAKE IT ONE TIME AT A TIME WHEN YOU SAVE ONE MAKE SURE TO 
RUN SERVER THAT WAY YOU WILL NOT GET ANY ERROR.

I can now extend from both the project template and the blog template


i had a problem with a loading the static (not found)
i resolved that by providing the full path for django to search 
through to find the location of static files in the.
STATICFILES_DIRS =[ os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'sitetemplate/static'),
in the settings.py file:                          |
                                                  v
                                        this is the path 
                                        (this gave me some seriouse problem to figure out)






i am making use of two base html one is named blogbase and it is inside the the blog app and takes care of all the pages associated wiht 
the blog while,
the other one is named base.html and it is inside the project directory this i am using to set up the portfolio app and pages related to the
